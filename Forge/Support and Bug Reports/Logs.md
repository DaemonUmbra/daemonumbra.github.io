# Finding Logs

When posting an issue on the Forge forums there usually isn't much anyone can do to help you if you do not provide logs.

<u>Forge VersionÂ 1.12.2-14.23.2.2629 and newer:</u>  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Post debug.log  

<u>Older versions:</u>  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Post fml-[client/server]-latest.log

<br/>

**<u>Mojang Launcher:</u>** When using the Mojang launcher one of these files will be found in [``.minecraft\logs``](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/.minecraft#Locating_.minecraft").  

**<u>Twitch Launcher:</u>** If you are using the Twitch Launcher, their configurations break Forge's log settings, unfortunately the method of getting around this is a bit convoluted, so it <a href=".\Twitch Launcher Log Fix">has its own page</a>.  

**<u>Fallback ("No logs are generated"):</u>**
If you don't see logs generated in the usual place, provide the ``launcher_log.txt`` from <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/.minecraft#Locating_.minecraft">``.minecraft``</a>
